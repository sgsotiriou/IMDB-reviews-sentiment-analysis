There were many things that made the movie not as good as I expected: poor writing, non-immersive acting from most characters & non-stop ear-deafening sounds among others.

However, what made this the worst movie I've ever seen in cinema is the quickspeakallwordswuicklyandmoveontothenextscene style editing which made the entire film feel like a three hour social media summary.

It was as if they refused to leave out a single scene, a singe line that was shot and just threw it all together with zero room to breathe.

One fast-paced dialogue with loud dramatic sounds after another, non-stop for the first hour, like a book with no punctuation or paragraphs, set me up for not engaging with or caring about a single character.

Linear, non-linear, doesn't matter. I loved Memento, Citizen Kane etc, Oppenheimer was just poor storytelling, speedy cuts and loud sounds.

I'm convinced the only reason it gained the extraordinarily high ratings it currently holds is due to hype, Nolan idolization and people being scared to admit they didn't "understand it" and in a short while people will look back at this movie and not fathom how in the world it could have been so well-recieved.

I genuinely wanted to like this movie, but it was appaling.
